    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Easy weeknight friendly spaghetti and meat sauce thatâ€™s made completely from scratch.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients Needed</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb lean ground meat</li>
        <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, <em>1 tbsp minced</em></li>
        <li>2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 cup water/broth/dry red wine</li>
        <li>1 can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>Salt and fresh ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Handful fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>12 oz dried spaghetti</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h4>Making the Sauce</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat (we use a Dutch oven). Add the meat and cook until browned, about 8 minutes. As the meat cooks, use a wooden spoon to break it up into smaller crumbles.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the onions and cook, stirring every once and a while, until softened, about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Stir in the garlic, tomato paste, oregano, and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring continuously for about 1 minute.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour in the water and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any bits of meat or onion stuck to the bottom of the pot. Stir in the tomatoes, 3/4 teaspoon of salt, and a generous pinch of black pepper. Bring the sauce to a low simmer. Cook, uncovered, at a low simmer for 25 minutes. As it cooks, stir and taste the sauce a few times so you can adjust the seasoning accordingly (see notes for suggestions).
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Cooking the Spaghetti</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            About 15 minutes before the sauce finishes cooking, bring a large pot of salted water to the boil, and then cook pasta according to package directions, but check for doneness a minute or two before the suggested cooking time.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>To Finish</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Take the sauce off of the heat, and then stir in the basil. Toss in the cooked pasta, and then leave for a minute so that the pasta absorbs some of the sauce. Toss again, and then serve with parmesan sprinkled on top. 
        </li>
    </ol>
