    <p>Delicious cozy cream cheese pasta ready in 10 minutes.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients Needed</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 lb pasta</li>
        <li>3/4 cup cream cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated parmesan</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1-2 garlic cloves, <em>minced or pressed</em></li>
        <li>1/4-1/2 tsp chili flakes</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook pasta according to package directions until al dente.
        </li>
        <li>
            Right before draining, reserve a cup of starchy pasta water.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, in a large skillet warm 1 Tbsp of olive oil and gently fry the garlic (plus a good pinch of chili flakes if you like) for 2-3 minutes. Use a low flame, do not let the garlic burn.
        </li>
            Then stir the cream cheese and about 1/2 cup of starchy pasta water. Stir to combine oil, cream cheese, water and create a nice and creamy emulsion. Add parmesan cheese and stir well. Your pasta sauce is ready.
        <li>
            Drain and add your pasta to the skillet. Stir well to evenly coat the pasta in the sauce, add more cooking water as needed for a smooth and creamy consistency.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve immediately with a drizzle of good olive oil or extra virgin olive oil, freshly grated parmesan, and freshly ground black pepper (if you don't use chili flakes). Enjoy!
