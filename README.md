# odin-recipes
A brief web development project from The Odin Project.

The project can be found at: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes

I wrote these files by hand without any help.

The recipe book contains 3 recipes: { 'Mushroom Pasta', 'Spaghetti', 'Cream Cheese Pasta' }.

It is a very bland project admittedly, but it is nonetheless the start of my journey in Full Stack Development.
